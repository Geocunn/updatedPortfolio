            Started building the new website this week from the ground up. Yet
            to incorporate react.js, but will be learning my way around the
            package later this week.

          <p>
            This week has been spend building my original portfolio website,
            using Github pages. The ultimate goal is to rebuild the ste from
            scratch so I have been learning some HTML and CSS. Along side that,
            I have been working on my CV - putting some finishing touches on
            that.
