        Hi, my name is George. I'm a recent graduate of Aerospace Engineering
        from the University of Manchester. I am currently working towards
        becoming a full stack Javascript developer by taking part in Northcoders
        14-week bootcamp. I have some experience with MATLAB and simulink
        through my degree, and I'm always eager to learn and pick up new skills.
